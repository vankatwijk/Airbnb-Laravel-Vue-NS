## Overview

**NativeScript UI SideDrawer** is part of [Progress NativeScript UI](https://www.nativescript.org/ui-for-nativescript) - a suite of rich-UI components targeting the NativeScript platform.

The **NativeScript UI SideDrawer** plugin allows you to have a hidden view that contains navigation UI or common settings. A popular application that uses the drawer UI is the Android Play Store app. The hidden view can be displayed with a flick gesture and can be shown from any of the four edges of the screen. The view is also displayed with a transition which can be chosen from a set of pre-defined transitions.
